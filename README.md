How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure this by completing all the needed testing and functionality requirements for the program. Firstly, I need to make sure that I have all the functionalities built into the program that the requirements call for. Without this built first, thereâ€™s nothing to test. Then, I would design unit tests to test the individual code blocks for each functionality. After that comes the integration testing, making sure that the right data is being sent to the right location.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
For me, I usually build the program into a draft phase. This helps me know what needs to be done and what might be required for user inputs. Once I have this done, then I can efficiently add anything needed and refine the rest of the code to make it clean. For me, this is the best way because it beats creating the whole program first before trying to modify it again, or, not finding out all the needs right away and still having to modify it. 

How do I approach designing software?
I approach software designing the same way as I do in the statements above. First, I usually create a small checklist of what needs to be done, sort of like the backlog in a development team. This helps me create what code is needed, as a draft, for the program. At this phase, I start doing a few tests, add more points to the checklist, and start refining and cleaning the code. Once I believe all the requirements are done, I start testing and fixing errors until the designing is complete.
